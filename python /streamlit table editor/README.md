CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) it is the cornerstone of working with database applications. Today I will walk through using the Streamlit python framework to build a web based app that you can use to interact with a database. The app will allow you to Read, Update, and Delete tables in your database.

The creators of Streamlit framework have taken care of a large amount of the burden of creating a web based app. However not all of the widgets are feature complete. Streamlit is an asynchronous framework allowing 100s or 1000s of users to use your app. With CRUD operations that is great for the Create and Read, but for Update and Delete, not so much.

Today’s tutorial will show you how to overcome those limitations and hopefully inspire you on how you could use Streamlit for your own apps.

All of the code is available on my Github page, please use responsibly.

NOTE: The code presented is not production ready; i.e. no Exception blocks but it wouldn’t take much more effort to adapt the code to be production ready. Instead we will concentrate on the important parts and get you downloading files quickly. Let’s start the tutorial below.
